        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <h2>Websites</h2>
        <p>First of I will start of with things people get confused which is the concept on how websites actually work, during this course I really grasped the knowledge of the websites work, websited render onto your screen because whenever you search something up it goes through your ISP(Internet Service Provider) which goes to a nearby DNS(Domain Name Server) that acts as a phone book and provides the neccesary files for that specifc website to render or show</p>
        <h2>Internet</h2>
        <p>Next thing I picked up was how the internet work, you can imagine the internet as a long piece of wire that connects different computers from different parts of the world and servers which enables them to share information with one another, it can also be described as something connects the client with a server</p>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>I then moved on to learn HTML(Hyer-text Markup language) which is defined as the building blocks for any website</p>
        <p>
            One of the tags i learnt was the header tag(h1-h6) for example:
            <h1>Heading 1</h1>
            <h2>Heading 2</h2>
            <h3>Heading 3</h3>
            <h4>Heading 4</h4>
            <h5>Heading 5</h5>
            <h6>Heading 6</h6>
        </p>
        <h2>Paragraph Element</h2>
        <p>
            Next up is the paragraph tag e.g:
            <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Self Closing Tags</h2>
        <p>
            Then there were the self closing tags which are also known as void element such as:horizontal line(hr) and break(br) they are mainly used to separate text to make them look neat for example:
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.<br /> Integer sit amet dui in libero rutrum dictum ut eget purus.<br /> Aenean nec quam auctor<br />, bibendum ipsum ac, rhoncus tortor.<br /> Vestibulum interdum congue congue.<br /> Pellentesque ornare est in magna dapibus, a rutrum odio lacinia.<br /> Ut eget mauris elementum, sollicitudin est at, dictum ex.<br /> Suspendisse auctor dictum condimentum.<br /> Suspendisse potenti.<br /> </p>
            <hr />
         </p>
         <h2>List Elements</h2>
         <p>These are tags that are used to organize items, like invetory list or shopping list e.g:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Shopping list </li>
            <ol>
                <li> Milk</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
            </ol>
         </ul>
         <h2>Nesting And Indentation</h2>
         <p> This part of the course basically talks about how you organize your code so it will be readable for other people or look presentable and well organized</p>
         <h2>Anchor Elements</h2>
         <p> These are elements used to create URL or hyper links to certain locations, for example;</p>
         <a href="https://www.lipsum.com/feed/html">This is a link to Lorem Ipsum</a>
         <h2>Image Elements</h2>
         <p>These are elemenst used to create or show images on a website e.g:</p>
         <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300"/>
         <h2>File paths </h2>
         <p>File paths are basically urls for file on your computer, they essentially help you to locate files </p>
         <h2> HTML Boilerplate</h2>
         <p>This is basically the stucture of your webpage, meaning the back bone of your webpage that makes it work e.g:</p>
         <img src="https://smartcodehelper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vs-code-html-boiler-plate-shortcut-windows.png"/>
         <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
         <p>A portfolio website is a website about yourself based on your experience in web development or any other activity, here is an example </p>
         <img src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Portfolio-website-of-the-product-designer-and-front-end-developer-Adham-Dannaway.webp"/>
         <h2>GitHub</h2>
         <p>Github is like a place for web developers to share there experience or progress in web developing with other people, it can also be a place to seek help or guidance for your projects</p>
